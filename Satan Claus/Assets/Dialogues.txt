So, Belcebu, what can I get you today? Another round of your favorite drink?
[NAME]Belcebu[NAME]*
[An]talk2[An]*
No, no, I don't want a drink today. I want something else.
[NAME]Player[NAME]*
[An]talk1[An]*
Oh? What is it that you want then?
[NAME]Belcebu[NAME]*
[An]talk2[An]*
I want a cat. A black cat with piercing green eyes.
[NAME]Player[NAME]*
[An]talk1[An]*
A cat? That's an interesting request. Any particular reason why you want a cat?
[NAME]Belcebu[NAME]*
[An]talk2[An]*
I've always been fascinated by cats. Their independence, their mysterious nature. I want a companion like that.
[NAME]Player[NAME]*
[An]talk1[An]*
I see. Well, I'll keep an eye out for a black cat with green eyes. If I come across one, I'll let you know.
[NAME]Belcebu[NAME]*
[An]talk2[An]*
Thank you, Player. I appreciate it. Let me know as soon as you find one.
